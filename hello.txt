<h2>This Is A Demo Task on GITHUB ACTION CI-CD Pipeline</h2>
<p>This second question relates to the CI/CD process. Write 1 Dockerfile config + 1 CI/CD Pipeline YAML
file.
* Preferably, the YAML file is for GitHub CI/CD. But if you are more familiar with other repos e.g.,
Bitbucket/Gitlab, feel free to use the syntax for that repo.
The tasks are:
- The YAML file will deploy from a docker image created by a Dockerfile.
- The Dockerfile needs to simply install Nginx and put the file from the repo named "hello.txt" into the
"/var/www/" folder. Let us assume that folder is the main folder that Nginx will read as a web server
- The Docker image then needs to be installed on an EC2 server on AWS and running</p>

<p>For GITHUB REPO and YAML CODE, Please refer to link
